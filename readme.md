## Install server locally
To control your presentation with Iphone you need a server. You can use http://remote.nodester.com but if you have slow connection, latency will kill awesomeness of your presentation. To prevent it you need to install server locally.

### Windows

```
   $ npm install remote-impress -g
   $ remote-impress
```
* run http://localhost in browser

### Linux

```
