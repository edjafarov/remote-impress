##Install server locally
To control your presentation with Iphone you need a server. You can use http://remote.nodester.com but if you have slow connection, latency will kill awesomeness of your presentation. To prevent it you need to install server locally.

###Windows
* Download and install node
* open terminal, install and run remote-impress

```
   $ npm install remote-impress -g
   $ remote-impress
```
* run http://localhost in browser

###Linux
* Install node.js
* install and run remote-impress

```
   $ sudo npm install remote-impress -g
   $ sudo remote-impress
```   
* run http://localhost in browser
